# Longest Common Sequence - Dynamic Programming

the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two input strings using dynamic programming.

## Description

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem involves finding the longest sequence that exists in both of the given strings.

### Input

The program takes the following inputs for each case:
1. Number of test cases (`T`)
2. Two strings for comparison (`str1` and `str2`)

### Output

For each test case, the program outputs:
- The length of the LCS
- The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of the two input strings
  
### Example

## Input
```
1
abcbdab
bdcaba
```

## Output
```
4 bdab
```
