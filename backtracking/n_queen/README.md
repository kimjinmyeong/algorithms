# N-Queen - Backtracking

## Overview

The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Input

The program takes the following input parameters:
1. The number of test cases to execute.
2. The size of the chessboard (N). It must be at least 4.

### Output

For each test case, the program outputs the indices of the queens' positions, starting from the top row.

## Example

### Input

```
1 // Number of test cases
4 // the size of chessboard
```

### output

```
1 3 0 2 // the queens' positions, starting from the top row.
```
